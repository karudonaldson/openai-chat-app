## Road Map

1. The concept is to allow an editor to easily review historical chat data, decide its fate, or next destination via the web portal, post it somewhere or archive, directly from the app.
2. While web portal will offer greater flexibility and capability, editing, sorting and filtering is super simple in app allowing a seamless access into stored data interfaced into  OpenAI's API directly.
3. No more cleaning out your OpenAI memory :)
